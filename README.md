## Abstract

Cryptocurrency market uncertainty is a significant factor causing the price bubbles in the NFT and Defi markets. We develop an early digital financial bubble detection mechanism for cryptocurrencies and provide real-time monitoring of fluctuations of cryptocurrencies using the method developed by Phillips and Shi. We have examined a period from 2017 to the first quarter of 2022, which includes the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ukraine-Russian war, and the US rate rise.

## About

The original version of this project was developed as part of a research endeavor aimed at exploring continuous bubble detection mechanisms in the context of cryptocurrencies. It was accepted for presentation at the 2022 INFORMS Annual Meeting, highlighting its relevance and significance in the field.
